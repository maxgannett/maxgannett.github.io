<h1>  What happend this week with Gamestop, WallStreet, and WallStreetBets</h1>
<p> Who would have thought about the impact of a community on a social media platform would have on Wall Street; a story that fits right in the times of the COVID-19 crisis. There are times in which social media is good in helping a collective effort achieve something like protests for democracy or against rights being infringed upon, and the use of social platforms this time to do something that has not yet be seen in the history books is pretty amazing. In understanding the question of the times of what happened with GameStop, Robinhood, and hedge funds is a question of which Is internet and social media platforms a human right? 
</p>
<p>	
The data from this action can really begin to help answer this question that is puzzling scientist today. Which evidently crosses with ideas of <a href="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/what-happened-with-gamestop/">David vs. Goliath</a> and what should rule and regulations be done for both users, platforms, and institutions. This is a treasure trove for researchers because all of this is done online and in platforms which give data researchers the rights to look at what really happened. With so much data comes a lot of understanding and insight to what really went down, a great temporal analysis of reddit comments and posts with the stock increase would be quite an interesting analysis. Leaving to the question can we answer the social divide in our country through the data produced by this event? One may say yes, but also say no.

<p>
There are many questions posed with what this class uprising and there is no right answer to how one should regulate it, enforce it, be responsible for what, and what does this mean for the future. Again, no right answer, but you can look to understand that there can be things said to what should be done from history. There is a lot of data here to help understand the picture and direct policy, some was taken like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robinhood-gamestop-stock/">Robinhood</a> stopping the buying of GameStop and other stocks to protect investors and cash flows. On the other hand, people view that as suppressing free speech. The right answers always lie in the middle of the area between black and white and so does this. It’s combination of new technologies and not up to date regulations and at the base of it all human’s interaction with the world around them. 
</p>
<p>	
Lastly, to be said about this is that it shows and I assume through the data collection and sentiment analysis of reddit and events that the common problem of data, emerging technologies and regulation. We see time and time again there is a problem with regulations and laws keeping up with the change in pace of the technologies that are changing up what it means for the landscape of countries, institutions, and the average user. The same problem occurs with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-bitcoin-and-qanon-how-the-wisdom-of-crowds-became-the-anarchy-of-the-mob-11611928823?st=jzh5kc9z0v5yxi1">disinformation/misinformation on platforms</a>, emerging tech or DNA processing. Many of these encapsulates the same problem this weird event as done, that there is a insufficient amount to be done with what it means at the intersection of government, corporations, and citizens. I don’t know the right answers but things do need to be done to acquire more knowledge and update laws to help better protect government and users.
